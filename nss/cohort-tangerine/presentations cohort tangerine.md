# Presentation Instructions

Each presentation should take approximately 5 minutes and cover the following material:

1. Goals (30 seconds)
  * Pull these from your elevator summary, user stories and/or README
1. Technologies/Techniques (30 seconds)
  * These should be things that are unique to your application (e.g. using a particular API or unusual gem)
2. Demo (2 minutes)
  * You don't have to demonstrate all of the functionality, just the high points.
3. Lessons Learned (1 minute)
  * This can be cathartic!
4. Question and Answer time (up to 5 minutes)
  * There will be questions, I promise.  Ask for questions and then pause while people gather their thoughts.
  * If you are listening to a presentation, ask questions!

## Important points to remember:

* If you have a slide deck through an online service, ensure that you have a local copy of it just in case.
* Speak loudly and clearly, facing your audience.
* DO NOT emphasize broken parts of your program.
* DO NOT insult your own work.
* Avoid referencing other student's presentations in a "well, they covered everything I had to say on my lessons learned".  Your presentation should stand alone.
* You are expected to have your laptop closed and your attention on the presenter.
