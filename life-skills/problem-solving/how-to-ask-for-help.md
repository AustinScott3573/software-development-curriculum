## How to Express Problems:

## Scenario 1

### Bad:

* It blew up
* It exploded
* It's not working for no reason

### Good:

Explain:

1. What it should do
2. What it did do
3. What you've already tried
4. Summarize error messages

## Scenario 2

### Bad:

* I'm sorry, but...
* This is a stupid question, but...

### Good:

Just ask the damn question.
