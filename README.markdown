software-development-curriculum
===============================

The goal of this repository is to aggregate all of the course materials I've developed in the first four Nashville Software School cohorts.

## The Plan:

This is the unified repository of all information we have/do cover in the software development fundamentals course at [Nashville Software School](http://nashvillesoftwareschool.com).  It is used by the [courseware](http://coursewareofthefuture.herokuapp.com) to populate the course materials.

## Contributions:

Contributions are quite welcome!

We have a ton of articles that you can contribute to documented in the Github issues for this repo.

## Notes:

Files with the ".markdown" extension are purposely ignored by the courseware, so that we can use that extension for non-curriculum notes and markdown files.

### Note to Contributors:

I (Eliza) have rewritten the repository history to remove the large files that caused the repository to bloat to 400+Mb.  Pro: this means pulling down the repository no longer involves half a gig of data transfer.  Con: this means that the history in your local repositories no longer remotely matches anything you may have in your local repositories.

### Note to Self, re: progress reorganizing the repo:
