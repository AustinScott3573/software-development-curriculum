#Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a framework that allows developers to make front-end content more user friendly, quickly.  It is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web.  It was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter.  Bootstrap has designed templates for interface compontents such as nav bars, buttons, modals and other interface components.  

Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns as the device or viewport size increases. It includes predefined classes for easy layout options for example btn for buttons.

NSS Cohort 10 learned Bootstrap v3.3.5 but [v4 alpha](http://blog.getbootstrap.com/2015/08/19/bootstrap-4-alpha/) is out with 4 beta being released soon.
